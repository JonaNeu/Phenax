Mosts of the files in this directory are taken from elsewhere in the repository. This was made in order to keep the addings independent.

The added files which contains our work are:
    - algo.py
    - logsConverter.py
    - marguerites.py
    - stats.py

All those files are to use as an API. A test function is defined in each of it in order to see what typical use can be made (or have been made to test the implementation)

* algo.py: contains algorithms to process graphs
* logsConverter.py: allow to transform a log file into the wanted format and generate basic json for the graph information
* marguerites.py: generates a json with marguerites information
* stats.py: make agregation of the results from json files

Generally, to add a new property that seem interessant (like marguerites) it is adviced to see how it is done in logsConverter.py and do the same. The basic architecture is to have 4 functions: two in order to serialize/deserialize your data and two in order to dump it into a json file or load it from the json file. To link two jsons from a same graph sample, you should work with dictionnaries like {'name':, 'directory':, 'new_property':}.

When dumping a json file, it can be interessant to particularize the name. We called our files by appending '_graph.json' and '_marguerites.json'.
