BranchExplorer and ForceCFI requires the different android.jar from
the Android SDK to work. These files are provided by the Android SDK
and are located in <your_android_sdk_dir>/platforms/android-*/ . 
There is one directory for each version of Android. 

AUTOMATIC INSTALL
=================

Use the provided script that will update all SDK versions and link them from this directory:

python3 update-sdk-and-links.py

MANUAL INSTALL
==============
You need to copy the android-* directories in this one (AndroidPlatforms) to make
BranchExplorer and ForceCFI work. They only need the android-*/android.jar
files so you can skip the other files. 

If you do not want to have duplicate files on your system, you can also
create symbolic files pointing to each one of the android-* directories.

At the end you should have something such as below in this directory. Each one
of these android-* directories contain an android.jar file. 

RESULT
======

$ ls AndroidPlatforms/
android-10 android-13 android-16 android-19 android-3  android-6  android-9
android-11 android-14 android-17 android-20 android-4  android-7
android-12 android-15 android-18 android-21 android-5  android-8
